Homework 1 : ML CS-7641 -
This project aims to implement and compare 4 machine learning algorithms (CNN, K-NN, SVM and Boosting) on two different datasets. I chose to work on Titanic (binary classification on tabular dataset) and CIFAR-10 (multi-class on images dataset). This project allows to evaluate classification capacity, prediction precision, execution time and aptitude to generalize of each algorithm.
We can find the datasets through these links :

I used generative AI Chat GPT to support me in the implementation of the codes.
I also used the following libraries: matplotlib, sklearn, scikeras, tensorflow.
